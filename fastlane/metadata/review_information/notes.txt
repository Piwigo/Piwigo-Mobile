This version brings an option allowing to rename files before upload and features dark and tinted app icons. The "Wi-Fi Only" option is now hidden on devices without cellular and one can now say "Siri, upload my photos to Piwigo" to add recent photos to the upload queue (requires the Auto-Upload option enabled).

Here is the address of the server requiring the above credentials and allowing to test all functionalities: https://piwigo.lelievre-berna.net/15.x/
And here are servers you can try without credentials: https://raia.com, https://www.neilfitzgeraldphoto.co.nz/gallery, http://www.dongshawhwei.com/photos.

The privacy policy is provided in the app in Chinese (Simplified), Danish, Dutch,  English, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.
